                The Assured Neuro-Symbolic Learning and Reasoning (ANSR) program aims to overcome the critical barriers
                that have hindered the realization of AI in safety and mission-critical autonomous systems. DARPA
                addresses two reasons for this. <em>''First, data-driven ML lacks transparency, interpretability, and
                  robustness and has unsustainable computational and data needs. Second, traditional approaches to
                  building
                  intelligent applications and autonomous systems that rely on knowledge representations and symbolic
                  reasoning
                  can be assured but are not robust to the uncertainties encountered in the real world.''</em>
                Our research directly addresses these challenges by pioneering a novel neuro-symbolic AI framework that
                enhances 3D scene representation in autonomous drones, aligning with the core objectives of the ANSR
                initiative.

                Our research enhances 3D scene representation and reasoning in autonomous drones by leveraging
                neuro-symbolic AI.
                Traditional methods for 3D scene representation relying on dense point clouds are data-inefficient and
                lack
                interpretability. We address this by integrating symbolic object models using the Universal Scene
                Description (USD) language. Our Neuro-Symbolic Conversion (NSC) framework automates object
                identification
                within point clouds, substitutes them with symbolic models, and validates these substitutions through
                visual
                comparison, improving data efficiency and reasoning for downstream scenarios understanding tasks
                efficiency.
                <br><br>
                The attached images illustrate our innovative approach, where object-wise point-cloud generation and
                symbolic
                representation in USD files create more interpretable and efficient 3D models. By matching objects using
                metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), we ensure the accuracy
                and
                robustness of these symbolic models. This methodology significantly contributes to the development of
                trustworthy autonomous systems, aligning with the objectives of the ANSR program. Our research has been
                recognized and published in prestigious AI venues, including the AAAI Workshop and ICAA, underscoring
                its
                impact in the field.

                The rapid evolution of semiconductor technology has propelled us into an era where System-on-Chip (SoC)
                designs and chiplet-based architectures are becoming increasingly complex. As we approach for compute
                advancement, the
                sheer scale of on-chip communication protocols, coupled with the intricate web of RTL (Register Transfer
                Level) blocks, presents unprecedented challenges in chip design. The growing sea of interconnected IP
                (Intellectual Property) cores has deepened, with advanced SoCs averaging around 205 IP blocks [as of
                2023], making
                the design process more daunting than ever.

                To keep pace with these complexities, the integration of AI into the design
                process has emerged as a crucial enabler. AI has the potential to revolutionize productivity, delivering
                a 20-25% increase in silicon and software development efficiency. This shift is not just a necessity but
                a strategic imperative for staying competitive in the semiconductor industry.

                costs—factors that are increasingly vital in an industry characterized by growing complexity and

                message flow specifications, which is crucial for identifying and resolving communication protocol bugs
                in complex SoC designs. The second challenge involves optimizing design space
                exploration to mitigate bottlenecks in High-Level Synthesis (HLS) implementation. These efforts are
                aimed at advancing the efficiency and reliability of chip design in the current technological landscape.

                The electronic design automation (EDA) community acknowledges the necessity of specification in system
                design and verification. An efficient and reliable set of specifications is the first step toward an
                efficient and reliable digital design. The lack of good quality specifications can cause catastrophes in

                exponentially growing search space, we enhanced our methodology by incorporating SAT solver-based trace

                language models (LLMs) to further improve the accuracy and efficiency of our specifications. This

                High-Level Synthesis (HLS) is vital for converting high-level algorithmic descriptions into hardware

          <p align="justify">Our research leverages neuro-symbolic AI to enhance 3D scene representation in autonomous

            scenes are represented by combining symbolic object models with neural-based background data.

            We developed a Neuro-Symbolic Conversion (NSC) framework to automate this process. The NSC framework
            identifies objects within point clouds, substitutes them with symbolic models, and verifies the integrity of
            these substitutions through visual comparison with the original scenes.

            This method significantly improves data efficiency and accuracy in object identification and substitution,
            making it highly effective for tasks such as entity identification, activity recognition, and object
            tracking in autonomous systems.</p>

            SoC validation based on the execution traces. In this framework, we have applied sequential rule mining with
            enhanced scalability. In addition, we address the shortcomings of existing algorithms that fail to reduce
            search space which grows exponentially as the length of the rule increases. Moreover, besides mining, a
            large set of rules is often redundant and cannot be helpful in many cases. So we prune search space and
            reduce the number of specifications utilizing SAT tools and RNN/NLP techniques.</p> -->

            In the pursuit of knowledge, research is not just a methodical process but a journey of intellectual
            curiosity, rigor, and perseverance. Every research endeavor is a step towards uncovering truths, challenging
            assumptions, and contributing to the collective understanding of our world. It is driven by a commitment to
            uphold the principles of integrity, critical thinking, and continuous learning.
            As I navigate this journey, I strive to adhere to the guiding principles that have shaped the work of many
            great scientists before me.

    <p style="font-family: 'Arvo', serif;"><strong>Florida IT Pathways to Success</strong></p>
    <p>Under the guidance of Dr. Ken Christensen and Dr. Rafael Perez, I work as a graduate assistant for "Florida IT Pathways to Success" (<a href="http://flit-path.org/">Flit-Path</a>) project. Flit-Path is an S-STEM project funded by National Science Foundation with the goal of providing scholarship, tutoring, and mentorship to academically talented but financially needy students at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering. This is a collaborative research effort between University of South Florida, Florida International University, and University of Central Florida.</p>
    <p style="font-family: 'Arvo', serif;"><strong>VAST Challenge 2017</strong></p>
    <p>In summer of 2017, I along with my friends took part in the <a href="http://www.vacommunity.org/VAST+Challenge+2017">VAST Challenge</a> under the guidance of <a href="http://www.cspaul.com/wordpress/">Dr. Paul Rosen</a>. VAST challenge is an annual competition where competing teams apply visual analytics on the provided data to solve the given problem. I worked on mini-challenge 3 which was about analyzing the given multi-spectral satellite image data to figure out the cause of decline in population of nesting pair of Pipit bird. We were required to complete this <a href="../rubel/rubel_files/vast2017/index.html">answer sheet</a> along with an explanatory <a href="./rubel_files/vast2017/usf-malla-mc3-video.mpg">video</a>. Our <a href="./rubel_files/papers/VAST2PageSummary.pdf">submission</a> was awarded honorable mention for "Good Facilitation of Single Image Analysis" at the IEEE VIS 2017 conference held on October 1, 2017 in Phoenix, AZ.</p>
