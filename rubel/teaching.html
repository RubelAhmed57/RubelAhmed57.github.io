          <div id="Boston" class="tabcontent" align="justify">
            <p align="justify">I had the opportunity to teach a course called Computer Architecture (CDA 4205) during
              the summers of 2022 and 2019. The goal of the course was to provide students with the core knowledge they
              need to understand instruction sets (specifically MIPS 32/RISC-V) and modern computing architectures. In
              the summer of 2022, I decided to take my teaching to the next level by attending a unique training course,
              <b>Preparing for College Teaching (PCT)</b>, organized by the Center for Innovative Teaching & Learning
              (CITL). I noticed significant improvements in my teaching style by applying scientifically proven
              <b>backward course design</b> and delivery methods I learned from PCT. The sections below describe my
              narrative for this course design and delivery, innovation, and success achieved in this course. Finally, I
              highlight some comments made by my students in the course evaluation.</p>

            <p><b>Syllabus: </b> A well-crafted syllabus is the first step toward a thoughtful course design. In
              addition, it serves as a formal agreement between the students and the instructor, outlining essential
              details such as grading policies, academic integrity guidelines, expectations for student conduct,
              attendance policies, policies on late submissions, and other pertinent information related to the course.
              I have consistently emphasized the importance of the syllabus as a fundamental component of the course.
              Therefore, during the first class, I provide a thorough overview of the syllabus and its contents,
              ensuring that all students understand its importance and the expectations set forth within it. To further
              reinforce the significance of the syllabus, I set a quiz during the second class, which evaluates the
              student's understanding of the syllabus and their ability to adhere to its policies. This
              <a href="rubel_files/teaching/syllabus.pdf" , target="_blank">sample syllabus</a> is the actual syllabus I
              developed for the course. The course content included standard learning materials as well as additional
              class activities, like pop-quiz, think-pair-share, concept maps, etc. There was a SMART (Specific,
              Measurable, Achievable (or Attainable), Realistic (or Relevant), and Time-bound.) end goal for every
              lecture in my class.
            </p>

            <p><b>Lesson Plan: </b> I consider lesson plan as a necessary tool to keep my learning objectives in mind
              throughout the lesson. I implement active learning strategies in my lesson plan. An example <a
                href="rubel_files/teaching/lesson_plan.pdf" target="_blank">sample lesson plan</a> can be downloaded
              here. I never forget to ask the muddiest part of the lesson by the end of each class.

            </p>

            <p><b>Assesment: </b> Assessment is an essential component of the teaching and learning process, as it
              provides feedback to both the teacher and the student about the effectiveness of the instructional methods
              being used. I used a variety of <b>summative </b> and <b>formative</b> assessments to gather a
              comprehensive picture of students' knowledge, attitudes, and skills, and utilized this information to
              improve the learning experience for everyone involved. A <a href="rubel_files/teaching/assesment.pdf"
                target="_blank">sample assesment</a> can be downloaded here.</p>

            <p>Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed teaching this course and am thrilled to have had the opportunity to enhance
              my teaching skills.</p>

            <h2>Innovation and Success</h2>
            <p>Innovation in classroom teaching can take many forms. As an educator, I strive to be unique and
              resourceful in my approach to teaching, constantly seeking new ways to engage my students and facilitate
              their learning. Some of the innovative techniques I applied successfully in my class are as follows.</p>

                      survey is a valuable tool for students, as it allows them to express their opinions and concerns
                      about the course and provide input into the learning process.</p>

            <p>I aim to excel in teaching courses fundamental to Computer Engineering, such as Program Design, Computer
              Architecture, Discrete Mathematics, Logic Design, etc. However, my broader vision is to enable human minds
              to think analytically. I believe teaching is a novel profession that provides knowledge and wisdom to
              society, and learning is a process of enlightenment.</p>

            <p>
              Learning is often regarded as a positive change in the student's behavior. I seek to facilitate students'
              learning on three H's, namely Hand (Psychomotor), Head (Cognitive), and Heart (Affective). My course
              design includes collaborative project activities (hand on), where each student needs to participate in
              brain-storming (head-on), and I embed a sense of accomplishment for each exercise so that the learning is
              enjoyable (heart-on) to them. My teaching conveys conceptual knowledge through standard methods. It
              encompasses syllabus design, lesson planning, classroom management, content development, and devising
              appropriate assessments to ensure learning happens. I believe the role of a teacher is to facilitate the
              complex and dynamic human learning process. Teaching and learning can occur in a self-evolving feedback
              fashion.</p>

            <p>
              While designing the syllabus for a particular course, I follow the backward course design strategy- I
              start with an end goal in my mind. The syllabus clearly articulates my expectations and what the students
              should expect to achieve from the course. Access to information has been so easy and pervasive that I
              don't prefer loading students with much information. Instead, I think it's the best time we emphasize the
              higher cognitive domain of Bloom's Taxonomy, like critical thinking. My learning outcomes exclusively
              focus on students' development of analytical ability. As a student of exact science (engineering), I
              design course outcomes that involve students' participation in collaborative projects, leading to the
              highest level of cognitive domain: creation. For each course I teach, learning outcomes for each lesson
              specify the audience, behavior, condition, and degree of the assessment.
            </p>

            <p>
              My principal concern for each class is planning a lesson and executing the plan accordingly. As a student,
              I learned best through active learning strategies. From the beginning of the course, I have worked towards
              building an engaging community in the class. I facilitate maintaining a rapport in the class by
              encouraging students to participate in various classroom activities like concept mapping, flash paper,
              problem-based learning, etc. Nowadays, the course could be more interactive using services like
              i-clickers, QR code scanners, flash/popup quizzes, etc. I ensure my students read assigned materials and
              use class time primarily for logical reasoning, connecting with the existing knowledge, open discussion,
              and formative assessments. A general approach I follow for each class is called the RPVRP method. It
              stands for reviewing today's lecture, previewing the last lesson, viewing today's class, reviewing today's
              lesson, and previewing tomorrow's class. I always remember to ask the students the muddiest point of that
              class to ensure the essential materials are appropriately delivered. In an online course, I will be
              available to answer students and follow the best practices for online teaching, such as ensuring students
              know the expectations, providing maximum availability, and building a sense of connectivity among students
              and teachers.

              As a teacher or learning facilitator, feedbacks are invaluable to me. I think students' feedbacks are most
              effective for a class if taken some time between the halfway of the course: mid-term feedback. Therefore,
              I collect mid-term feedback to evaluate my teaching and adjust as necessary. I always welcome discussion
              regarding the course delivery and intend to improve incrementally. My teaching activity amalgamates
              traditional and online teaching resources to bring the best of both worlds. I am open to enhancing my
              skills as an educator using peer review and reflective portfolio and attending workshops on teaching.

        <p><q>No matter what has happened to you in the past or what is going on in your life right now, it has no power to keep you from having an amazingly good future if you will walk by faith in God. God loves you! He wants you to live with victory over sin so you can possess His promises for your life today!</q> -Joyce Meyer</p>
