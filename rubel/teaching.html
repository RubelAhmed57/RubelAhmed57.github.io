  <p>I plan to excel teaching the Computer Architecture course; however, my broader vision is to enable human minds to think analytically. I believe teaching is a novel profession that provides knowledge and wisdom to society, and learning is a process of enlightenment. </p>

<p>Learning is often defined as a positive change in the student's behavior. I strive to facilitate students' learning on three H's, namely Hand (Psychomotor), Head (Cognitive), Heart (Affective). Teaching conveys conceptual knowledge through standard methods applied from syllabus design, lesson planning, classroom management, and content development to devising appropriate assessments to ensure that learning happens. The role of a teacher is to facilitate the complex and dynamic human learning process. I think teaching and learning can occur in a self-evolving feedback fashion. </p>

<p> While designing the syllabus for a particular course, I will follow the backward course design strategy- that is, I will start with the end in my mind. The syllabus will clearly articulate my expectations and what the students should expect to achieve from the course. I believe the access to information has been so easy and pervasive that it's the best time we emphasized the higher cognitive domain of Bloom's Taxonomy, like critical thinking. My learning outcomes will be more focused on the development of the analytical ability of the students. Being a student of exact science (engineering), I plan to include outcomes that involve students participating in collaborative projects, which is regarded as the highest level of cognitive domain: creation. For each course I will teach, learning outcomes for each lesson will specify the audience, behavior, condition, and degree of the assessment. </p>

<p> Lesson planning and making sure the plan is executed accordingly will be a principal concern for each class. As a student, I found I have learned best through active learning strategies. From the beginning of the course, I will work towards building a community in the class. I believe in maintaining rapport in the class. Students will participate in various classroom activities like concept mapping, flash paper, problem-based learning, etc. I believe this age of technology has made it quite possible to make the class more interactive using services like i-clickers, QR code scanners, flash/popup quizzes, etc. I will ensure my students read assigned materials and use class time primarily for logical reasoning, connecting with the existing knowledge, open discussion, and formative assessments. A general approach I intend to follow for each class is the RPVRPmethod that stands for reviewing today's lecture, previewing the last class, viewing today's class, reviewing today's class, and previewing tomorrow's class. I will remember to ask the students the muddiest point of that class to ensure the essential materials are appropriately delivered.
In an online course, I will be as available as possible to answer students and utilize the best practices for online teachings, such as ensuring students know the expectations, providing maximum availability, and building a sense of connectivity among the students the teacher. </p>

<p> I had an opportunity to teach an undergraduate course here at the USF. The default USF instructor evaluation/feedback comes at the end of the semester. As a teacher or learning facilitator, this feedbacks are invaluable to me. I think such evaluations are most effective for a class if taken some time between the halfway of the course: mid-term feedback. I will collect mid-term feedbacks so that I can evaluate my teaching and adjust as necessary. I will always be welcoming for discussion regarding the course and intend to improve incrementally. My teaching activity will amalgamate both traditional and online teaching resources to bring the best of both worlds. I am open to enhancing my skills as an educator using peer review, reflective portfolio as well as attending workshops on teaching. </p>

    <p><q>Never stop fighting until you arrive at your destined place - that is, the unique you. Have an aim in life, continuously acquire knowledge, work hard, and have perseverance to realise the great life</q> -A.P.J. Abdul Kalam</p>
    <p><q>No matter what has happened to you in the past or what is going on in your life right now, it has no power to keep you from having an amazingly good future if you will walk by faith in God. God loves you! He wants you to live with victory over sin so you can possess His promises for your life today!</q> -Joyce Meyer</p>
