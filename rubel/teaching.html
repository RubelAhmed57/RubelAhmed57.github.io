    <p align ="justify">I taught the course Computer Architecture (CDA 4205) in the summer of 2022 and 2019. This course aims to give core knowledge about Instruction Set (MIPS 32/RISC-V) and modern computing architectures. I delivered lectures for a 2.5 hrs session twice a week. I followed <b>backward course design</b> during my teaching. There was a SMART end goal for my students. I have designed both <b>summative </b> and <b>formative</b> assessments for this course. I led weekly discussion sessions, assisted students during office hours, and provided and taken timely feedback. My teaching evaluation score is higher in many sections than average in the College of Engineering at USF.

<p>I prepare to excel in teaching the Computer Architecture course; however, my broader vision is to enable human minds to think analytically. I believe teaching is a novel profession that provides knowledge and wisdom to society, and learning is a process of enlightenment.</p>

<p>Learning is often defined as a positive change in the student's behavior. I seek to facilitate students' learning on three H's, namely Hand (Psychomotor), Head (Cognitive), and Heart (Affective). Teaching conveys conceptual knowledge through standard methods applied from syllabus design, lesson planning, classroom management, and content development to devising appropriate assessments to ensure learning happens. The role of a teacher is to facilitate the complex and dynamic human learning process. I think teaching and learning can occur in a self-evolving feedback fashion.</p>

<p>
  While designing the syllabus for a particular course, I will follow the backward course design strategy- that is, I will start with the end in my mind. The syllabus will clearly articulate my expectations and what the students should expect to achieve from the course. I believe access to information has been so easy and pervasive that it's the best time we emphasize the higher cognitive domain of Bloom's Taxonomy, like critical thinking. My learning outcomes will be more focused on the development of the analytical ability of the students. Being a student of exact science (engineering), I plan to include outcomes that involve students participating in collaborative projects, which is regarded as the highest level of cognitive domain: creation. For each course I teach, learning outcomes for each lesson will specify the audience, behavior, condition, and degree of the assessment.
</p>

<p>
  Planning a lesson and ensuring the plan is executed accordingly will be a principal concern for each class. As a student, I learned best through active learning strategies. From the beginning of the course, I will work towards building an engaging community in the class. I facilitate maintaining a rapport in the class. Students will participate in various classroom activities like concept mapping, flash paper, problem-based learning, etc. I believe this age of technology has made it quite possible to make the class more interactive using services like i-clickers, QR code scanners, flash/popup quizzes, etc. I will ensure my students read assigned materials and use class time primarily for logical reasoning, connecting with the existing knowledge, open discussion, and formative assessments. A general approach I intend to follow for each class is the RPVRP method which stands for reviewing today's lecture, previewing the last lesson, viewing today's class, reviewing today's class, and previewing tomorrow's class. I will remember to ask the students the muddiest point of that class to ensure the essential materials are appropriately delivered.
  In an online course, I will be available to answer students and utilize the best practices for online teaching, such as ensuring students know the expectations, providing maximum availability, and building a sense of connectivity among students and teachers. 
</p>

<p> 
  I had the opportunity to teach an undergraduate course twice here at the USF. I have received formal and informal feedback. As a teacher or learning facilitator, these feedbacks are invaluable to me. I think such feedbacks are most effective for a class if taken some time between the halfway of the course: mid-term feedback. Therefore, I will collect mid-term feedback to evaluate my teaching and adjust as necessary. I will always welcome discussion regarding the course delivery and intend to improve incrementally. My teaching activity will amalgamate traditional and online teaching resources to bring the best of both worlds. I am open to enhancing my skills as an educator using peer review and reflective portfolio and attending workshops on teaching.
